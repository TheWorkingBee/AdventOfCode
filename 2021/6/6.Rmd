## Task description
In this task we are given a file with strings. The rows grouped and sepparated by a blank line. We are to count the number of unique letters within each group and find their sum. 

## Task solution
```{r}
#Prepare input data
file_name <- "input_file_6.txt"
input_file <- read_lines(file_name)
```
```{r}
find_letters <- function(str_arr, found) {
  for (chr in str_arr) {
    if (chr %in% found) {
      next
    } else {
      found <- c(found, chr)
    }
  }
  found
}

found <- c()
sum <- 0
for (row in input_file) {
  if (row == ""){
    found <- c()
  } else {
    strs <- str_split(row, "", simplify = 1)
    new <- find_letters(strs, found) 
    sum <- sum + length(new) - length(found)
    found <- new 
  }
}
sum
```
