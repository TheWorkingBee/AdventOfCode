## Task description
We are given a file with two lines. The first represents an arrival time (minutes), and the second represents bus ID:s, where the ID:s are their arrival-times. Our task is to find the bus bus with departure closest to the arrival time. We are to answer with bus ID * wait time. 

## Task solution
```{r}
#Prepare input data
rm(list=ls())
file_name <- "input_file_13.txt"
input_file <- read_lines(file_name) 
```
```{r}
arrive <- input_file[1] %>% as.numeric()
ids <- Filter(function (x) x != "x", input_file[2] %>% str_split(",", simplify = 1)) %>% as.numeric()

n_departures <- (arrive/ids) %>% ceiling()

wait <- (n_departures * ids) -  arrive

min_wait <- min(wait)

id_index <- match(min_wait, wait)

ids[id_index] * wait[id_index]
```
