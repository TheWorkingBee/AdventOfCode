Day 5
================

## Task description

We are given a file where each row represents a seating position on an
airplane. The airplane has 128 rows, where each row has 8 seats. In the
file these are represented using 10 letters. The first 8 represent
determine the row number using the letters F and B (front and back
respectively). Those are read from left to right and each letter means
that you select the front or back row of the seats until there is only
one left. The last three consist of R and L (light and left
respectively), and determine the seat in the same way. This airline
starts it indices at 0 instead of 1.

Our task will be to find the seat with the highest id (where the id is
row \* 8 + seat).

## Task solution

``` r
#Prepare input data
file_name <- "input_file_5.txt"
input_file <- read_lines(file_name)
```

``` r
decode_str <- function(str_arr, interval, lower_letter) {
  for (char in str_arr) {
    mid <- (interval[1] + interval[2])/2
    if (char == lower_letter) {
      interval[2] <- floor(mid)
    } else {
      interval[1] <- ceiling(mid)
    }
    #print(interval)
  }
  
  interval[1]
}

get_id <- function(str) {
  split_str <- str %>% str_split("", simplify = TRUE) 
  row_code <- split_str[1:7]
  seat_code <- split_str[8:10]
  row <-  decode_str(row_code, c(0,127), "F")
  seat <-  decode_str(seat_code, c(0,7), "L")
  row * 8 + seat
}

max_id <- -1
for (str in input_file) {
  id <- get_id(str)
  max_id <- ifelse(max_id <= id, id, max_id)
}
max_id
```
