## Task description
We are given a file where each row describes what other bags a certain bag color contains. For example: light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags. We are to figure out which bags can contain shiny gold bags.

## Task solution
```{r}
#Prepare input data
file_name <- "input_file_7.txt"
input_file <- read_lines(file_name)
```
```{r}
extract_content <- function(str) {
  str_arr <- str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
  color <- str_arr[1:2]
  contains <- 
  for (str in str_arr[-(1:5)])
}

contains_gold <- c()

for 
```
