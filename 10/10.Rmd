## Task description
Given a file with numbers on each row, we are to sort the numbers and count the number of times there is a difference of 1 or 3. The initial number is compared to 0 and the last one to a number that's 3 larger. 

## Task solution
```{r}
#Prepare input data
rm(list=ls())
file_name <- "input_file_10.txt"
input_file <- read_lines(file_name) %>% as.numeric()
```
```{r}
input <- input_file %>% sort()
#Last connection will be 3
n_3 <- 1 
#First connection is one
n_1 <- 1

for (i in 2:length(input)) {
  diff <- input[i] - input[i - 1]
  if (diff == 3) n_3 = n_3 + 1
  if (diff == 1) n_1 = n_1 + 1
}

paste("n_3: ", n_3, ", ", "n_1: ", n_1)
n_3 * n_1 
```
